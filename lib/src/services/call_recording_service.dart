/// ## How this works (and its limits)
///
/// Since Android 10 + the May 2022 Play policy, an app **cannot** record the
/// phone call itself. The only compliant way to obtain call audio from a normal
/// cellular call is to read the file the device's *built-in* dialer writes when
/// the user has enabled "auto record calls". This service does exactly that:
///
///   1. Ensures the broad-storage permission (`MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`).
///   2. Scans the known vendor recording folders for the newest audio file.
///   3. Returns it as a [CallRecording] so it can be uploaded for transcription.
///
/// Caveats the UI should communicate to the user:
///   * Android only. iOS has no call auto-recording and is always [unsupported].
///   * Requires the user to have turned on auto-recording in their dialer — the
///     app cannot toggle that setting programmatically.
///   * Pixel / stock Android store recordings in private storage we cannot read.
